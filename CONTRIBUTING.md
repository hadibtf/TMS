# Contributing to the Metro Time Schedule App

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your help is greatly appreciated.

## Style & Formatting

- **Code Style**: We follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). Please ensure your code adheres to these guidelines.
- **Formatting**: Use `dart format` to automatically format your code before committing.

## Branching Strategy

- **`main`**: This is the primary development branch. All new features and bug fixes should be based on this branch.
- **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each new feature or significant change (e.g., `feature/add-new-screen`).
- **Bugfix Branches**: For bug fixes, use a branch name like `fix/issue-description`.

## Pull Request (PR) Template

When submitting a pull request, please include the following:

- **A clear and descriptive title.**
- **A summary of the changes made.**
- **Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").**
- **Screenshots or recordings for any UI changes.**

## Running Tests

To run the full test suite, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Review & Merge Process

1. **Submit a PR**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
2. **Code Review**: At least one other developer will review your code for correctness, style, and best practices.
3. **Approval & Merge**: Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
